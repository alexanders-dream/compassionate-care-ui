To teach your class effective UI/UX design based on the source material, you can organize the tips into five core pillars, progressing from beginner mistakes to senior-level strategies.
Here is a summary of the design tips from the transcript:
1. Copywriting: Clarity is Key
• Opt for brevity and clarity: Beginners often use too many words or unclear labels (e.g., "earn tokens" when the action is "claim rewards").
• Reduce cognitive load: Senior designers communicate better with less. Avoid repeating words if the context is already established; for instance, do not write "last 10 votes" if the header already says "Voting".
• Use AI for assistance: A practical tip for improving labels is to take a screenshot of the UI, upload it to ChatGPT, and ask for copy that is clear but short.
2. Visuals: Function Over Flashiness
• Avoid overuse of effects: Beginners tend to use flashy gradients and blur effects that clutter the design. If unsure, opt for simplicity; a simple, understandable graph is better than a fancy one that is hard to read.
• Visuals must communicate: Visual elements should serve a purpose, such as using contrast (like a red dot against gray bars) to tell the user exactly what to focus on.
• Create visual patterns: Help users make connections by reusing visual patterns. For example, if a "live" status uses a pulsing circle, use that same element elsewhere to signify the same status, achieving more with less.
3. Color: The 60-30-10 Rule
• Limit strong colors: Overusing strong colors (like bright red) creates visual stress.
• Use the 60-30-10 approach: To balance the palette, make 60% of the UI a neutral color (white/gray), 30% a complimentary color (like black), and 10% the main brand color.
• Use shades and tints: Instead of using "all the colors of the rainbow," create depth by using different shades or tints of a single color.
• Reserve color for emphasis: Senior designers often use simple flat colors for the background and save the main color strictly for important elements like graphs, icons, or error states.
4. Typography: Restrict Variety
• Limit sizes and weights: A common mistake is using too many font variations (e.g., 6 sizes and 4 weights). A solid rule of thumb is to stick to four font sizes and two font weights,.
• Use functional fonts: Consider using a monospace font for numbers to ensure alignment and avoid collisions when data values grow large.
5. Spacing and Structure: The 8-Point Grid
• Avoid random spacing: Beginners often use arbitrary pixel values (e.g., 11px or 25px), which makes the design feel unstructured.
• Apply the 8-Point Grid System: Ensure every number in the design (margins, padding, sizing) is divisible by 8 or 4. For example, use 24px instead of 25px.
• Group logically: Use spacing deliberately to group related elements together, ensuring the structure is calculated rather than random,.
The "Hidden" Senior Mistake: Static vs. Dynamic
Even senior designers make the mistake of focusing solely on static screens. To create a memorable experience, designers must treat the UI "like a movie," piecing screens together with transitions that make the app a pleasure to use, rather than just a collection of static images.

Analogy for your students: You can explain that designing a UI is like setting a dinner table.
• Beginners clutter the table with every utensil and decoration they own (too many colors/fonts), making it hard to find the food.
• Seniors place only what is necessary (clarity/simplicity), align the silverware perfectly (8-point grid), and ensure the centerpiece (main action) draws the eye immediately without shouting.
