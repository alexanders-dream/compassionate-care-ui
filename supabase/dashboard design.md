Visual Layout & Structure
• Navigation: Avoid bulky grid bars that distract from data; implement minimalist tabs that blend into the background to help users focus.
• Header Distinction: Do not style headers like regular rows; highlight the header with a tint color to make it distinct and easy to spot at a glance.
• Row Styling: Avoid dark row borders, which are harsh on the eyes; lighten the border shade to allow focus on the data. Additionally, increase row height to give data "room to breathe," preventing the clutter and visual tension caused by tight, compact rows.
Data Presentation & Formatting
• Numeric Alignment: Do not left-align numbers, as this makes comparison difficult. Right-align numbers so users can compare values by looking at digit placement from left to right.
• Date Formats: Avoid using month numbers, which can lead to confusion regarding date formats (e.g., DD/MM vs. MM/DD). Abbreviate month names (e.g., Jan, Feb) to ensure dates are interpreted instantly.
• Status Indicators: Replace plain text statuses with status chips, utilizing color and shape to reflect urgency levels effectively.
• Record Hierarchy: Bold the record names in the primary column to signify importance and help users identify specific data entities easily.
Interactivity & Signals
• Sorting Cues: Avoid subtle gray icons for sorting; apply a blue accent to sorting icons to make the function obvious and encourage interaction.
• Action Buttons: Reduce "textual noise" by replacing text buttons with icon buttons, creating a stronger visual signal. For bulk actions, pair text labels with icons to reduce cognitive load and help users distinguish between actions quickly.
• Search Fields: Avoid small, uninviting search inputs. Use a wider text field with an icon to emphasize the search functionality.
